Agent Smith is a Background Agent for Agile Pattern Detection and PO Support

---
## 1. **Executive Summary**

Agent Smith is a **background intelligent agent** designed to operate silently across product development workflows. Its purpose is to observe, analyze, and act upon key delivery and collaboration patterns, with a focus on supporting Product Owners (POs) in driving agile adoption and improving delivery consistency.

Unlike traditional tools that require active engagement or manual queries, Agent Smith works **proactively and invisibly**, surfacing insights and alerts only when necessary. This avoids adding another tool to the already saturated stack, and instead acts as a **guiding presence**—a kind of _digital Sherpa_ for agile leadership.

---
## 2. **Problem Statement**

Despite wide exposure to agile practices, many teams struggle with genuine adoption. Common indicators of friction include:

- Excessive work in progress (WIP),
- Sprint rollover becoming the norm,
- Tickets left unreviewed or unupdated,
- Repeated bottlenecks and coordination issues.

Agile tools exist (Jira, Confluence, Miro, etc.), but insights are fragmented. Stakeholders must seek out problems manually, and dashboards often go unused or misinterpreted. This leads to passive failure and a general fatigue toward process improvement efforts.

See [[PROBLEMS]] for more details about the problems we have identified.

## 3. **Proposed Solution**

Agent Smith will act as a **silent, continuous background agent**, embedded into the tooling ecosystem. Its architecture is based on three core capabilities:

### A. **Observation & Pattern Detection**

- Passive data collection from project sources (e.g., Jira, Git, retrospectives)
- Detection of predefined and dynamic patterns (e.g., chronic underestimation, WIP inflation, irregular commits)

### B. **Analysis & Decision-Making**

- Specialized sub-agents focus on different scopes (e.g., Sprint Agent, Story Agent, WIP Agent)
- A central **Decision Agent** synthesizes signals and determines whether action is needed

### C. **Proactive Communication**

- When patterns are detected, Agent Smith sends **contextual alerts** to the PO
- Notifications are sent via Slack, email, or other channels, depending on preferences
- Alerts are tailored, minimal, and actionable — not overwhelming or repetitive

## 4. **User Experience & Interface**

The entry point for users is a simple, lightweight dashboard hosted on the internal portal:

> **`https://rover.redhat.com/apps/agent-smith`**

POs log in and declare:

- Their team(s)
- Their project(s)
- Preferred communication channels

From that point on, the background agents begin analysis without further user action.

The dashboard provides:

- A timeline of alerts
- Summary metrics
- Configuration settings (channel, frequency, project scope)

---

## 5. **Scoping the Initial Rollout**

To ensure success and limit complexity, the initial target group will be **Product Owners (POs)**. This has several benefits:

- POs are structurally embedded in teams
- Their role aligns naturally with process optimization and agile reinforcement
- Limiting the audience reduces the number of stakeholders to align

This scoping enables a repeatable model that can later be expanded to:

- Engineering Leads
- Scrum Masters
- Project Managers

---

## 6. **Architecture Overview**

**System Components:**

- **Background Worker Agents**: Modular components analyzing domain-specific patterns (e.g., story churn, blocked issues)
- **Central Decision Agent**: Consolidates findings and determines alert priority
- **Notification Dispatcher**: Sends alerts via multichannel communication
- **User Dashboard**: Web interface for registration, preferences, and review

**Data Sources:**

- Jira
- GitLab/GitHub
- Slack logs
- Retrospective tools (if integrated)

**Technologies Considered:**

- Python (backend agents)
- FastAPI / Flask (dashboard backend)
- Slack API / SMTP for notifications 
- ML frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for future predictive capabilities

---

## 7. **Machine Learning Potential**

While the initial implementation may use rule-based heuristics (e.g., “more than 6 stories in progress per developer”), the long-term roadmap includes:

- **Pattern learning from historical data**
- **Predictive sprint outcomes**
- **Early detection of team fatigue or overcommitment**

These capabilities can evolve organically, leveraging accumulated data and refining models as more teams onboard.

---

## 8. **Benefits**

- **Reduces tool fatigue**: No new interface required for day-to-day use
- **Enables proactive leadership**: PO is guided without needing to dig through dashboards
- **Fosters real agile practices**: Agent highlights anti-patterns as they emerge
- **Scales easily**: SaaS-style deployment allows for easy onboarding
- **Integrates smoothly**: Built to complement existing tools, not replace them

## 9. **Next Steps**

|Phase|Action|Owner|Deadline|
|---|---|---|---|
|1.|Draft technical prototype for one detection pattern (e.g. WIP limit breach)|Engineering|T+1 month|
|2.|Build minimal dashboard for PO registration & preferences|UX / Frontend|T+1.5 month|
|3.|Run pilot with 2-3 POs|Agile Enablement|T+2 months|
|4.|Collect feedback, iterate pattern rules, validate usability|Product Ops|T+2.5 months|
|5.|Expand agent set and communication channels|Engineering|T+3 months|

---

## 10. **Conclusion**

Agent Smith provides a silent yet impactful way to reinforce agile best practices, reduce PO cognitive load, and improve team delivery. By acting behind the scenes, it avoids tool overload while introducing a lightweight decision-support system for agile leadership.

The approach is scalable, modular, and built for SaaS-style onboarding. It favors insights over dashboards, action over reporting, and habit formation over rigid process enforcement.
