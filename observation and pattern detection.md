### **A. Observation & Pattern Detection**

Observation is the foundation of Agent Smith. Its role is to extract weak signals from internal collaboration tools without disrupting team workflows. The goal is to surface collective dynamics, early warnings, and deviations from agile practices. This layer is structured into four independent and extensible subsystems:

***
#### 1. **Passive Observation — Data Collection Layer**

Agent Smith collects data passively from the tools already used across the organization, requiring no manual action.

**Current data sources**:

- **Jira**: tickets, statuses, transitions, assignments, comments
- **Slack**: message frequency, mentions, team channels
- **Retrospective tools**, calendars, team velocity metrics (when available)

> _Git and upstream things are intentionally excluded from the current scope to focus on coordination and planning flows. However, the architecture should remains modular and compatible with future integration if needed._

***
#### 2. **Interaction Mapping — Graph-Based Modeling**

Collected data is projected onto a **directed graph** representing team dynamics and project entities.

**Nodes**:

- Team members
- Stories, tickets, sprints, discussion channels

**Edges**:

- Interactions (comments, assignments, Slack replies, co-presence)
- Can be weighted by frequency, recency, or significance

**Technology**: **Neo4j** is used for visual and analytical exploration of team relationships (centrality, isolation, influence, dependencies).

***
#### 3. **Heuristic Detection — Rule-Based Pattern Engine**

A lightweight rules engine detects common inefficiencies and breakdowns in process execution, example:

- Too many stories “in progress” at once
- No PO comment on active stories
- Stories untouched for X days
- High number of “To Do” ↔ “In Progress” transitions

This engine provides an interpretable baseline for both initial usage and later ML refinement.

***
#### 4. **Adaptive Detection — ML-Based Pattern Discovery**

As data accumulates, Agent Smith will progressively learn from team behaviors, identify weak signals, and uncover predictive combinations:

- **Temporal anomalies**: irregular work cycles, drop in activity
- **Team behavior clustering**
- **Risk prediction on stories or sprints**
- **Graph-based learning (GNNs)**: detecting unusual relational structures

This layer introduces intelligence incrementally, without overwhelming the system or its users.
