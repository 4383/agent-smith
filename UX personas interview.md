We're designing the next evolution of Agent Smith: a smart assistant that supports Product Owners in staying ahead of team dynamics and delivery risks. This interview will help us understand how you work, what slows you down, and what kind of interaction would truly make a difference in your day-to-day."
## 🧠 1. **Context & Responsibilities**

> To understand the PO role and their work environment

- What’s the size of your team? How many squads or product streams do you oversee?
- How involved are you in the day-to-day sprint activities?
- Would you describe yourself as more product-oriented, technical, or delivery-focused?
- How do you interact with developers, tech leads, and managers?
- How many products or projects are you managing in parallel?

---

## 🛠 2. **Tools & Workflows**

> To understand how POs use Jira, Slack, etc.

- Which platforms/tools do you use every day?
- How do you typically use Jira? (dashboards, backlog grooming, reports…)
- What takes up the most time for you in Jira?
- Do you have any shortcuts or automations you rely on?
- How do you monitor team dynamics? Do you rely on Slack or other signals?

---

## 📊 3. **Team Monitoring & Visibility**

> To identify frustrations and blind spots

- How do you know when a team is doing well? What signals do you rely on?
- How do you detect problems (blockers, slippage, misalignment)?
- Are there moments where you feel in the dark?
- Have you ever discovered a problem too late? What was it?
- What rituals (daily standup, sprint review…) give you the most confidence in the team’s progress?

---

## 🚨 4. **Alerts & Signal Handling**

> To guide the alert design logic

- In what situations would you absolutely want to be notified?
- Do you prefer frequent simple alerts, or fewer but high-confidence ones?
- Are you concerned about being over-alerted? What do you consider "noise"?
- What would make you trust the relevance of an alert?
- Through which channel would you prefer to receive alerts? Slack? Email? Something else?

---

## 🤖 5. **Conversational Agent & Usage Projections**

> To evaluate acceptance of a smart assistant

- Have you ever used a bot or agent to manage tasks or monitor tickets?
- Would you feel comfortable asking: “Why is this sprint off track?” or “Which stories are at risk this week?” to an agent?
- What would be the most useful things to ask this assistant?
- When in your day or week would you most likely want to interact with such an agent?
- Would you prefer summaries, guided dialogue, or free-form queries?

---

## 📈 6. **Continuous Improvement & Feedback**

> To plan the feedback loop

- How do you incorporate retrospectives into your workflow?
- Do you have a way to centralize weak signals or patterns to watch?
- What’s your biggest frustration as a PO right now?
- If you could have **one superpower** as a PO, what would it be?
- What feature would make you want to adopt Agent Smith right away?
