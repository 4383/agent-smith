Welcome to the Agent Smith Zettelkasten Obsidian vault.
The goal of this vault is to brainstorm around agent smith (editorial lines, ideas, etc).

## Why Zettelkasten?

This repository adopt the [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) methods to allow to a structure to emerge automatically from our various works.

With time it is hard to maintain repo of notes composed of several sub-folders. Folders introduce lot of complexity and the with time the system become hard to maintain. We do not want to spend time maintaining a note system, that's not our goal.Our goal is to spend our time creating valuable things.

## How to use this vault?

All the notes (apart templates) are at the same level of this git repository (the root level).
Each file should simply contains the base [[template-note]] structure to allow us to create a meaningful structure from all our files. All our notes should be at the markdown format.

Here are key Zettelkasten concepts:
- MOC stands for Maps Of Content;
- MOC are great and general categories (e.g: marketing, tools, ideas, law, physic, science, etc);
- MOC are hubs for our notes;
- MOC is a way to give the big picture of a specific area of knowledge (e.g science, maths);
- MOC titles are in capital letters to make them more visible. (e.g [[TOOLS]]);
- Non MOC notes should be an atomic concept (e.g: "string theory", "euclidean geometry", "marketing funnel");
- Non MOC notes should be linked to a MOC in a way or another;
- Non MOC notes can also reference other Non MOC notes;
- MOC can reference Non MOC notes;
