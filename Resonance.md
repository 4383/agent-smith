Resonance is all about physics

> _When systems vibrate in sync, even small inputs can create massive change._

Here are some key concepts to consider resonance:
- In agile teams, moments of shared vision, alignment, or motivation can create “resonant” breakthroughs.
- Likewise, misalignment creates dissonance—small frictions become large obstacles.
- **Impact on agility**: Tune into team rhythm. Sometimes, the system isn’t blocked—it’s just _out of sync_.
