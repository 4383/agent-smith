## Toulmin Argumentation for "Nobody loves to run a race with new shoes"

## Claim (Assertion)

We must leverage AI (through Agent Smith) to enable a sustainable and company-wide Agile transformation at Red Hat, or risk falling behind in the current business paradigm shift driven by AI.

## Data (Evidence / Facts)

- AI is a business paradigm shift as disruptive as the advent of the Internet. Companies ignoring it today would repeat Microsoft's mistake of underestimating the Internet 30 years ago.
- Red Hat has undergone a major DNA change following the IBM merger and is in the middle of an Agile transformation.
- Agile adoption is difficult: literature shows consistent barriers such as lack of alignment, organizational maturity, and stakeholder buy-in (sources provided).
- AI makes it now feasible to implement and operationalize Agile at scale via advanced concepts (Chain of Thought, RAG) and tools (Agent Smith).
- Agent Smith has been designed as a LangChain agent, able to translate executive intent into actionable Agile behaviors and coordinate team actions.

## Warrant (Bridge between facts and claim)

Since AI is both an environmental pressure and an opportunity to drive internal DNA change, using it purposefully is the best way to align our Agile transformation with current business needs. Without such leverage, our transformation would be too slow to keep pace with the external environment.

## Backing (Justifications)

- The analogy with system administration pre/post-IaC shows that AI can play the same role for project management as Ansible did for infrastructure — making abstract processes reproducible and actionable.
- The moral foundation of Open Source is to share knowledge and tools for the common good. Agent Smith, as an open-source initiative, fits this vision perfectly.
- Giving Agent Smith to Red Hatters is both a natural continuation of Red Hat’s Open Source values and a pragmatic way to reduce friction in Agile adoption.

## Qualifier (Degree of certainty)

It is now practically feasible, thanks to AI, to implement a meaningful and sustainable Agile transformation across a large organization such as Red Hat.

## Rebuttal (Counter-arguments or limitations)

- AI is not a magic wand: cultural change and human involvement remain key.
- Agent Smith will require continuous iteration and adaptation to fit evolving needs.
- Success depends on collective involvement: without team feedback and engagement, the tool alone will not be sufficient.
