## 🧩 EPIC 4 — **ML-Based Enhancement and Adaptive Pattern Discovery**

**Type**: Epic  
**Title**: Enable Adaptive Pattern Detection Through Machine Learning

### **Goal**

Introduce machine learning capabilities into Agent Smith in order to learn from past data, uncover emerging patterns, and predict risks that can’t be captured by static rules. This Epic focuses on establishing the foundations for ML inside the architecture and enabling gradual experimentation with low-risk models such as anomaly detection, clustering, and simple classification.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Identify and prepare ML-friendly datasets from historical PostgreSQL and Neo4j data
- Create first pipelines for supervised and unsupervised learning
- Train baseline models (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection, sprint outcome prediction)
- Document performance and relevance of each approach
- Plug model outputs into the Decision Agent without breaking the pipeline
- Enable model explainability and feedback loop from POs (optional)

---

### **Open Questions**

- Do we log PO feedback to refine models (active learning)?
- Should we favor team-specific models or global ones?
- How do we handle concept drift (teams evolve)?

## 🧱 Tasks Breakdown

---
### 🔍 SPIKE 4.1 — Frame ML Use Cases and Risks

**Type**: Spike  
**Title**: Define potential ML applications for Agent Smith  
**Goal**: Explore relevant ML approaches and assess risks/complexity.

**Timebox**: 3 days

**Deliverables**:

- Matrix: use cases × ML types (e.g., sprint success prediction → binary classifier)
- Risk assessment (false positives, fairness, explainability)
- Prioritized list of 3 ML targets for PoC

---
### 🔍 SPIKE 4.2 — Assess ML Readiness of Existing Data

**Type**: Spike  
**Title**: Evaluate PostgreSQL and graph data for ML preparation  
**Goal**: Identify gaps in data quality, structure, or labeling.

**Timebox**: 2–3 days

**Deliverables**:

- Notebook or report describing:
    - Available features (team activity, issue timelines, graph centrality)
    - Labels (e.g., sprint completed on time, issue stuck)
    - Preprocessing needed (normalization, time windowing)

---
### 🔧 TASK 4.3 — Create ML Feature Store

**Type**: Task  
**Title**: Design and implement a reusable feature generation pipeline  
**Goal**: Enable consistent preparation of data for training and inference.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Feature store includes:
    - Static metadata (e.g., story points, assignee role)
    - Temporal features (e.g., age, time in progress)
    - Graph-based metrics (e.g., centrality, number of interactions) ([[Graph Theory]])
- Exportable as CSV or Pandas DataFrame
- Reusable pipeline with config file to define time window and scope

---
### 🔧 TASK 4.4 — Train First Unsupervised Model (Anomaly Detection)

**Type**: Task  
**Title**: Identify stories, sprints or users with unusual patterns  
**Goal**: Experiment with unsupervised learning to detect outliers.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Model trained (e.g., Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, Autoencoder)
- Identifies outliers in historical sprints or user behavior
- Outputs stored with score and explanation (e.g., “too few interactions”)
- Hooked into alert pipeline as low-priority suggestion

---
### 🔧 TASK 4.5 — Train First Classifier (Sprint Risk Prediction)

**Type**: Task  
**Title**: Predict if a sprint is likely to fail (not complete stories)  
**Goal**: Test supervised learning on labeled sprints.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Model trained with XGBoost or logistic regression
- Features: velocity, WIP, interactions, ticket age
- Target: “Sprint ended with incomplete stories”
- AUC > 0.70 on validation
- Inference results stored with confidence score and top 3 features

---
### 🔧 TASK 4.6 — Plug ML Results into Decision Agent

**Type**: Task  
**Title**: Use ML predictions to enrich decision-making  
**Goal**: Allow ML outcomes to influence alerting decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- ML results interpreted with thresholds or calibration
- ML “uncertain” flags filtered or tagged
- Decision Agent treats ML outputs as optional input
- Alert metadata includes “predicted risk score” if applicable

---
### 🔧 TASK 4.7 — Enable Feedback from POs on ML Alerts (Optional)

**Type**: Task  
**Title**: Collect feedback on alert relevance for model retraining  
**Goal**: Create a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- PO can tag alert as “useful” / “false positive” via Slack button or dashboard
- Feedback stored in PostgreSQL for model improvement
- Feedback logged with alert ID, PO ID, timestamp
- Future: Use to tune threshold or train next-gen models

***
### 🔍 SPIKE 4.8 — Use Genetic Algorithms to Evolve Alert Rule Parameters

**Goal**: Investigate how [[genetic algorithms]] can be used to evolve the thresholds, weights, or combinations of rules used in the heuristic or decision engine, based on historical alert outcomes and PO feedback.

**Timebox**: 2–3 days

**Deliverables**:

- [[Python]] notebook or script using a GA library (e.g., DEAP or PyGAD)
- Example genome (rule configuration)
- Fitness function based on real or synthetic data
- Visualization of convergence or diversity of the population
- Summary of results and potential integration paths
