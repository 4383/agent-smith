Capillarity is all about fluid mechanics.

> _Small pathways emerge where flow is easiest._

Here are some key concepts about capillarity:
- In nature, water doesn’t always take the shortest path, but the _path of least resistance_.
- In teams, this can mean information doesn’t flow through official channels, but through relationships, chat groups, or emotional trust networks.
- **Impact on agility**: Observe where knowledge flows most easily—those “capillaries” may be more vital than your formal reporting lines.
