To fight the [[resistance to change]] we need to humanize change management

Here are the steps to do that:
1. Include the people involved from the start
	ðŸ‘‰ Don't present the change to them as a fait accompli. Give them a role in defining, testing, or adjusting the change.

2. Create a clear and engaging narrative
	ðŸ‘‰ Explain why the change is happening, what it will actually bring to everyone, and how it will unfold. Use stories, real-life examples, and visual comparisons.

3. Appoint human liaisons
	ðŸ‘‰ Identify "change ambassadors" in each team, respected by their peers, who will answer questions, allay fears, and raise weak signals.

4. Communicate often, even when there's "nothing new"
	ðŸ‘‰ Frequent and transparent communication builds trust. It's better to say "we don't know yet" than nothing at all.

5. Measure and adapt the pace
	ðŸ‘‰ Offer tests, progressive trials, and feedback. It's the "listen-adjust-reassure" cycle that reduces resistance.

## The intensity of the acceptance

## Change Management Methods ([[METHODOLOGIES]])

1. **ADKAR Model**
    _Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement_ â€” Focuses on individual change and behavior shift.
2. **Kotterâ€™s 8-Step Change Model**
    A step-by-step framework to drive organizational change effectively.
3. **Lewinâ€™s Change Management Model**
    Three stages: _Unfreeze â†’ Change â†’ Refreeze_ â€” Disrupt the status quo and stabilize the new.
4. **McKinsey 7S Framework**
    Aligns 7 internal factors (Strategy, Structure, Systems, Skills, Style, Staff, Shared Values) for successful change.
5. **Nudge Theory**
    Uses subtle behavioral cues and positive reinforcement to influence change without force.
6. **Prosci Change Management Methodology**
