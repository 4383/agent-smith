The Epic structure reflects a progressive, modular approach to building **Agent Smith as an intelligent assistant for Product Owners**, capable of detecting, interpreting, and surfacing agile patterns proactively. Each Epic corresponds to a **distinct level of maturity and autonomy**, forming a coherent processing pipeline:

1. **Epic 1** lays the **technical foundation**: passive data collection, structured storage, and graph projection. ([[epic 1 - foundations backend architecture and data ingestion]])
2. **Epic 2** leverages **graph theory** to detect weak signals in team dynamics. ([[epic 2 - Graph-Based Pattern Detection for Decision Support]])
3. **Epic 3** introduces a **Decision Agent** that filters and contextualizes alerts. ([[epic 3 - Decision Agent and Alert Delivery System]])
4. **Epic 4** brings in **machine learning** to adapt and uncover unseen patterns. ([[epic 4 - ML-Based Enhancement and Adaptive Pattern Discovery]])
5. **Epic 5** delivers an **interactive, conversational dashboard** that helps POs configure, explore, and act on alerts through dialogue and graph visualizations. ([[epic 5 - Conversational Dashboard Agent with Graph Visualization]])

This structure ensures we can **scale complexity safely**, while remaining focused on business value: reducing PO cognitive load, increasing visibility on team frictions, and supporting agile leadership with meaningful, real-time signalsâ€”not just intuition.
