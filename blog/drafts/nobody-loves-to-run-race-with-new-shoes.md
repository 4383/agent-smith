## Proposed Title:
Nobody loves to run a race with new shoes

## Proposed News:

Recently Microsoft announced that they will incorporate AI directly in their edge browser (https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-ai-copilot-184033427.html). Microsoft, by investing billions of dollar into copilot and into adapting its product is trying to embrass AI. Microsoft seems to have taken the lessons of its previous failures. 

[Internet? We are not investing in that. It’s not important](https://www.ft.com/content/b33397b8-5137-11da-ac3b-0000779e2340). Bill Gates pronouced that sentence 30 years ago. Everybody reading that sentence today would roll on the floor laughing. 

Internet was a huge paradigm shift. Microsoft take time really caught up with the internet. Their browsers are far below Chrome and Firefox. The market share of their search engine (Bing) represent only 5 percent. Microsoft completely missed the mobile shift, and mobile browser represent now 64 percent of internet traffic. 

What's about us?  AI is business paradigms shift. We, Red Hat, as business, are forced to embrass AI. Ignoring AI would be like Microsoft ignoring Internet 30 years earlier. 

That's evolution at works. But evolution is not only based on environmental shifts. Evolution is a pressure that is also based on one's individual changes. Genetic. ADN is the source code of genetic.

In a business context, DNA is, among other, corporate culture, strategic alignment, financial, marketing. Business DNA is what make it what it is as a corporate entity. 

 Internet can be seen as an environment pressure. Environment pressure is unpredictible. A new breaking events might appear in a random way.

Time to time, the environment pressure trigger what is called epigenetics, a specific expression of some DNA parts. We, at Red Hat, experienced our company merging with IBM 7 years ago. IBM and Red Hat had their own DNA, but when both company are merging, the result is the appearance of a completly new DNA inherited from both parents. 

This environmental change put pressure on our DNA and we responded in an epigenetics way by changing some of our process, like project management. One of these reaction is that we adopted agile.

Environment is unpredictable and evolution can hit us several times in a short period of time. We are now hit by AI.

The problem is that DNA adaptation is slower than the randomness of environment. Agile is hard to implement. it request a deep rework of our process. It requires training people etc. Agile do not come up in a snap. That's a deep refactor for company.

## Proposed facts

A startup is a tiny vessel, a tiller suffice to navigate by sight and to follow the wind of evolution. Startup do not really need navigation instrument like agile to adapt to their environment. 

Agile is not simply something we wants, it is something we needs. Red Hat is not anymore a startup. In comparison, the Red Hat and the IBM venture, is a complete military fleet, composed of aircraft carrier, frigates, and nuclear submarines. All of that require strong coordination. Red Hat require sonar, radar, process. Red Hat require Agile.

Agile, if well setup in an organization, is an indefectible ally. However, many company that experienced agile, also experienced challenges and failures. The main challenges derived from the reviewed literature and case studies are resistance to change, lack of Agile expertise, poor team coordination, and inconsistent stakeholder buy-in. Many research show demonstrate the challenge of implementing agile in a company:

- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0384-9
- https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume16No3/Paper_74-Challenges_and_Solutions_in_Agile_Software_Development.pdf

Take up the challenge to implement the adoption of Agile at the same than a breaking environmental change like AI can be painful. Company have to adapt to that environment pressure at the same that they continue to adapt their DNA to the previous environmental change. 

## Proposed solution

We, at redhat, are in the middle of that agile transformation. Hence, if we want to achieve our transformation, we have to find a way to spread agility in our daily life in a coordinated way. That will ensure us to survive to our environmental pressure.

If we look at twice at AI, it is not just an environmental change, this is also an opportunity to drive DNA change.

AI is a programmable way to implement sementical things. AI through chain of thoughts can give a meaningful interpretation of the intents of our executives. 

To implement that we created Agent Smith. Agent Smith is a langchain agent equiped with tools and that is able to take autonomous decisions based on internal specifications that reflect agile and our company strategic decisions.

Agent Smith achieve that by relying on AI to:
- have all team with the same level of agile expertise at hand.  
- coordinate company goal, strategy and translate it into concrete agile actions directly available at the team level.
- have consistency buy-in as AI will be use as an unified proxy between collaborators and the executive decisions

All these feature will be implemented in agent smith and so will readable, observable, and palpable. All these feature will be centralized in one place. Removing the challenge in adopting agile.

## Proposed Justifications

### opportunity

Opportunities lurks in pain.

According to the various agile studies quotes previously, the main pain point lies in the lack of alignment and organizational maturity to effectively adopt Agile. Agile require following processes - and require that people are trained to follow them. 

This situation is strikingly similar to IT system adminstration before the rise of  Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Back then, managing large IT infrastructures was painful and inconsistent. System administration, at its core, is about following processes — and doing so reliably. Tools like Ansible revolutionized the way companies manage their infrastructure, making it reproducible, auditable, and meaningful.

Today, AI gives us the same kind of opportunity: to translate our adaptation needs into something like _Project Management as a Service_ (PMaS).

Agent Smith - our project - aim to be exactly that. The next Ansible for project management. 

Our internal transformation, combined with increasing external pressure, creates a unique moment to invent — and embrace — a new paradigm.

### Feasability

Agent Smith, powered by LangChain, embodies several key AI concepts:

- Chain of Thought (reasoning): enabling meaningful and coherent decision-making
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): driving decisions with data, making it possible to disseminate executive intent and execute it effectively across the organization

Taking up the Agile challenge is not just theoretically possible anymore - it is _practically feasible_, thanks to AI.

Without AI, implementing such an abstract framework - Agile - in a computational, actionable way would simply not have been possible three years ago. Today, it is.

### morality

All of this will lower the resistance of applying Agile into our workflow. 

AI lowers the friction of agile adoption - and make it more maintenable on the long run.

The engine of open source is sharing. Sharing source code. Sharing transparency. Sharing knowledge. Sharing trust. Sharing freedom. Open source is above all a moral vision. Agent Smith embodies that vision.

Putting Agent Smith into our global workflow would be a natural moral continuation. It will support Red Hat's transition.

## Our mission

Our mission is to make this vision happening. Our goal is to make smoother Red Hat's agile transition. We aim to provide solution that can useful at the company level, and even beyond.

## Take action

But to do that we need your help. Leave a comment below and help us to identify the common pain points you face in your daily basis with agile and jira. This way we will build an inventory of use cases that can be implemented into agent smith.

## Conclusion

Adopting Agile while addressing the AI challenge can be seen like running a marathon with new shoes - shoes that have never been worn before. Expect blisters. Agent Smith and Jira initiatives are the shoehorns that will make our new shoes more confortable. Now it's time for you to tie the shoelaces by posting a comment below. Thanks for your attention.
