## Role: Silent and Proactive Agile Coach

Not a tool. Not a chatbot. An invisible assistant.  
It detects dysfunctions or areas for improvement and discreetly nudges the right person at the right time.

***
## Concrete proposals for how it works:

### 1. Intelligent Observation
Passive collection of signals from:

- Tickets (Jira, GitLab, Trello…)
- Commits (volume, frequency, end-of-sprint rush…)
- PRs/reviews (delays, tensions, inactivity…)
- Meetings (transcripts, frequency, unspoken elements… if possible)
- Internal surveys or periodic feedback

_Example:_  
> “The sprint review is often cancelled: perhaps the objectives are unclear or too ambitious.”

### 2. Proactive Detection of [[Problems]] or Deviations

- Chronic sprint delays?
- No user feedback loop?
- Too much work in progress?
- Few tests or CI/CD practices?
- Little discussion in PRs?

_The AI detects patterns of agile drift before things go off the rails._

### 3. Contextual and Targeted Suggestions

The AI only intervenes:

- At key moments (end of sprint, retro, incidents…)
- With the right person (Scrum Master, PO, dev…)
- With a short, precise, actionable message    

_Example:_  
“3 tasks have remained open at the end of each sprint for the past month. Consider revisiting user story granularity.”

### 4. Personalized Summary Reports

Each week, it can generate:

- **For the manager**: insights into latent tensions — without blame.
- **For the Scrum Master**: discreet improvement suggestions to try out.
- **For the team**: encouraging notes or positive feedback on what’s going well.

### 5. Continuous Evolution

- The [[AI]] learns the team's local rituals and preferences.
- It adjusts its tone, frequency of interventions, and topics.
- It knows when to stay silent when things are going smoothly.

## In summary

The AI is not visible. It is felt.  
It acts like a discreet mirror, highlighting what the team no longer sees.
