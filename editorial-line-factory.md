## Purpose of this Document

To create effective online content, we must begin by:

1. Defining the value we want to share
2. Identifying our viral potential

These two elements will serve as a framework for designing all our future content.

They will be our compass — saving us time, energy, and confusion.

## Action 1: Define the Value We Will Bring

Talking about value means being clear about the *real reason* people would engage with our content — be it a newsletter, an article, a post, or a guide.

People will engage with what we publish **if it helps them move forward toward a meaningful or desirable goal**.

For instance, we might help our readers build stronger communities around their open source projects.

Other possible goals:

* Helping readers manage the design and development of their open source projects more effectively
* Helping readers understand and integrate open source principles into their information systems

It’s because this goal — the one we choose to focus on — is desirable, and because we will aim for it in everything we publish, that our content will feel consistent and build a loyal audience.

Let’s do the exercise:

Complete this sentence:
**Thanks to our content, our audience will gain tools to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

To go further, we can list the types of tools, insights, or methods we plan to share.

Examples:

* Open source governance methods
* Specific architecture models
* Community-friendly decision-making processes (e.g., consensus-based voting)
* Tools that optimize community resources (linters, CI/CD pipelines)
* Communication strategies for community projects (chat, outreach, handling crises, etc.)

Let’s do the exercise:

## Action 2: Identify Our Viral Potential

To succeed online and build momentum over time, we must aim for **relevance and resonance**.

We can't just stay in our comfort zone and hope something catches on by chance.

We must align what we publish with what truly captures people’s attention.

What drives interest?

* What creates buzz
* What’s timely or newsworthy
* What feels bold, rare, or insightful
* What people want to repeat in conversations to sound “in the loop”

Let’s be direct:
**If we don’t aim for visibility and relevance, the project will lose traction.**

We’ll reach too few people, gain little feedback or engagement, and lose motivation.

Let’s avoid that.

So here’s the key question:
**What hot or trending topics can we connect our content to?**

We need to become aware of what’s *moving* in our field.

Let’s practice by filling in the lists below:

**List 1: What recent topics have sparked strong interest in our domain?**

(1) \_\_\_\_\_

(2) \_\_\_\_\_

(3) \_\_\_\_\_

(4) \_\_\_\_\_

**List 2: What recent events have been widely discussed in our field?**

(1) \_\_\_\_\_

(2) \_\_\_\_\_

(3) \_\_\_\_\_

(4) \_\_\_\_\_

**List 3: What recent controversies have caused debates in our domain?**

(1) \_\_\_\_\_

(2) \_\_\_\_\_

(3) \_\_\_\_\_

(4) \_\_\_\_\_

**List 4: What are the most recent tools, products, or books released in our space?**

(1) \_\_\_\_\_

(2) \_\_\_\_\_

(3) \_\_\_\_\_

(4) \_\_\_\_\_

**List 5: What are people currently afraid of in our domain?**

(1) \_\_\_\_\_

(2) \_\_\_\_\_

(3) \_\_\_\_\_

(4) \_\_\_\_\_

One important note:

It’s perfectly normal to struggle with these lists at first.

The more we practice, the more naturally we’ll spot relevant and timely topics.

However, if at this stage we believe it’s impossible to find current trends or, worse, if we believe our field has no “hot topics,” it might be a sign we’re not engaged enough to create regular content.

Because **when we’re passionate**, we naturally follow the pulse of our field — and we want to contribute to the conversation.

No field is ever “off the radar.”
We just need to learn how to shine a light on current issues from within our perspective.

So if we’re passionate about our domain, eager to stay connected to what’s happening, and want to become a trusted voice when things shift — this process will put us on the right track.

## In Summary:

Being effective in online content creation relies on two ingredients:

* **The value we bring**
* **The relevance and resonance we aim for**

With this exercise, we’ve begun clarifying the value we want to offer and identifying our potential for visibility.

**Our mission is to help our audience grow by focusing on a topic that truly matters to them.**
