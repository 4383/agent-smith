## Definition

Here is the definition ([[DEFINITIONS]]) of desir path. A **desire path**, also known as **desire line** in transportation planning and many other names, is an unplanned small trail formed by erosion caused by human or animal traffic. The path usually represents the shortest or the most easily navigated route between an origin and destination, and the width and severity of its surface erosion are often indicators of the traffic level it receives.

Desire paths typically emerge as convenient shortcuts where more deliberately constructed paths take a longer or more circuitous route, have gaps, or are non-existent.

## Individuals are the heart of Agile

the individual and their desires are at the heart of Agile. It’s no surprise, then, that **"desire lines"** could emerge around agility—understood in the Deleuzian sense as vectors of projection, aspiration, and even capture. ([[Various aspects of agility]])/

Agile doesn’t just offer a new way of organizing work—it **promises** things people deeply crave in today’s professional world: autonomy, recognition, meaning, collaboration. These promises naturally give rise to strong lines of desire.

Here are a few examples of such desire lines around agility:

1. **Desire for freedom** – escaping rigid hierarchies, reclaiming control over one’s time and workflow.
2. **Desire for recognition** – being seen, heard, valued through visibility and team rituals.
3. **Desire for meaning** – contributing to something useful, aligned with personal values.
4. **Desire for belonging** – being part of an "agile tribe" with its own culture, language, and symbols.
5. **Desire for power** – becoming a Scrum Master, Product Owner, or Agile Coach—roles charged with symbolic authority.
6. **Desire for transformation** – believing in a new kind of company: more human, more ethical, more alive.

But here’s the tension: these desire lines can also be **captured**, **redirected**, or **exploited**.  
What begins as a desire for emancipation can morph into a form of control.  
What starts as a quest for meaning can devolve into managerial theater wrapped in colorful post-its.

## Desire lines in workflow

Let’s now deepen the idea of **desire lines**, but this time not just in terms of identity or roles, but in terms of **workflow**: how people actually move through work, make decisions, and bypass constraints. In this context, desire lines reveal the _true paths_ people take—not the official process, but the one they **want** to follow.

### Desire Lines in Workflow: The Hidden Paths of Agility

In architecture, a "desire line" is the path worn into the grass by repeated human use—it reveals where people **prefer** to walk, not where the pavement tells them to.

In workflows, desire lines operate the same way.

They expose where the team’s **energy**, **motivation**, and **focus** naturally flow—regardless of process diagrams, stand-ups, or backlogs.
#### 1. From rigid workflows to living paths

Traditional project management prescribes a fixed path: requirements → design → implementation → testing → delivery.  
Agility promised to replace this with something more adaptive. But even within Agile frameworks, desire lines still emerge.

- Developers who skip Jira because the board doesn’t reflect reality.
- Product Owners who prefer informal chats over grooming sessions.
- Teams who use shadow Kanban boards, custom scripts, or Slack emojis to track work.

These aren't failures—they’re **expressions of desire**: for simplicity, speed, control, clarity.
#### 2. Desire as a compass: how people signal friction

Every time someone breaks the rules of the prescribed process, it’s not necessarily sabotage—it’s a signal.  
Desire lines often emerge:

- **Around blockers** – people route around bureaucracy or unclear ownership.
- **Toward flow** – when the official path is too slow or fragmented.
- **Against overload** – when process demands exceed cognitive load.

Desire lines are thus **diagnostic tools**. They tell you where your system isn't working for real humans.
#### 3. Designing _with_ desire, not against it

Rather than forcing people back onto the "paved" process, Agile (at its best) evolves to **accommodate** desire lines:

- Allowing asynchronous stand-ups when time zones clash.
- Embracing tools like Notion, Obsidian, or Miro when Jira feels too heavy.
- Letting teams create their own rituals, metrics, or cadences.

The most resilient workflows **don’t resist desire**—they absorb it. They treat deviation as feedback, not failure.
#### 4. Desire lines and the future of agile tooling

What if tools didn’t enforce workflows—but **learned** them?

Imagine:

- A backlog tool that reshapes itself based on your team’s actual behaviors.
- Dashboards that highlight your _unofficial_ communication loops.
- Alert systems that detect when work is flowing outside the mapped process—and ask _why_.

In such systems, desire lines aren’t erased—they become the blueprint.
### Final thought

Desire lines aren’t noise. They’re the music your workflow _wants_ to play.  
Agility, if it wants to remain true to itself, must listen—and build not from top-down frameworks, but from the ground-up energy of human intent.
