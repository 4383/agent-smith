People are resistant to change. That's a fact. 

Why? Lets see:
- Why are they resistant to change?  
    → Because they are afraid of what the change might bring.
- Why are they afraid of what the change might bring?  
    → Because they don't know exactly what will change or how it will affect them.
- Why don’t they know what will change or how it will affect them?  
    → Because communication about the change is vague, delayed, or absent.
- Why is communication vague, delayed, or absent?  
    → Because decision-makers underestimate the importance of human support during change.
- Why do decision-makers underestimate this aspect?  
    → Because they still see change as a technical project, not as a human process. ([[TECHNOLOGIES]], [[Cognitive Sciences]])

People are afraid of new [[technologies]] ([[AI]]), and of new ways ([[METHODOLOGIES]]) of doing there work.

Resistance to change comes from a lack of human support, caused by an overly technical or strategic vision of change.
